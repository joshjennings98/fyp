## Abstract

## Introduction

## Background

### Spiking Neural Networks

### POETS

## Related Work

### BRIAN

### SpiNNaker

### Current POETS SNN Implementations

## Aims and Objectives

[//]: # (it is often to clearly identify the high-level objectives, in a sub-section on their own. Given the vague project description, how have you refined it into more meaningful goals? There are quite a few directions that could be taken in this area - what have you chosen to prioritise, and why? Make sure you try to define what success would like at a high-level.)

### Roadmap

[//]: # (this could be either a coarse-grain chunky road-map, or a more detailed plan - ideally it would be both, with the former aligned with your goals, and the latter describing what you've done or are about to do.)

### Planned Implementation

### Planned Evaluation Methods

[//]: # (it's possible you're planning on addressing this elsewhere, but make sure you have split between: The metrics you're using to evaluate performance and/or the definition of success The methods you're planning to use to actually measure that performance, and why getting particular results would support any claim that something is good. The first one is more associated with the our high-level objectives, while the second is associated with how you plan to evaluate it once it is built \(which is what is implied here\).)

### Risks

## Current Progress

### Supervisor Meetings

### Technical Progress

## Ethical, Legal and Safety Plan

[//]: # (The Ethical, Legal and Safety Plan must detail what are the issues in this are relevant to your project, showing how you will comply with best practice. If there are no such issues \(the case for 80\% of all projects\) you must nevertheless show here that you have considered these issues and detail why they will not apply to your project. Information will be provided on the project web pages about Ethical, Legal and Safety matters.)

### Ethical Plan

This project doesn't involve work that could be used to harm humans or animals. It therefore doesn't pose any ethical issues and thus no ethical plan is needed.

### Legal Plan

There are no legal issues with this project. It doesn't require the use of other peoples patents, and the final product won't be patented.

I will make sure to give the final product a License so that any future developments continue to not cause legal issues.

### Safety Plan

#### Electrical Safety

This project doesn't involve high voltages or currents and therefore this is not a risk.

#### Physical Safety

This project does not use hardware, so physical risks should not be an issue. The project is being carried out in an area where there are other people doing hardware projects. I will make sure that the work I carry out on this project does not interfere with other people. As well as this, I will make sure that all cables such as charging cables and monitor cables are kept out of the way to reduce tripping hazards.

#### Chemical Safety

This project doesn't involve chemical sand therefore this is not a risk.

#### Fire Safety

This project doesn't use any equipment that might be fire hazard such as batteries or high temperature equipment and therefore this is not a risk.

#### Biological Safety

This project doesn't involve biological stuff and therefore this is not a risk.

#### Animal Safety

This project doesn't involve animal testing and therefore this is not a risk.

#### Appliance Safety

The only portable hardware used is my laptop. The laptop and relevant equipment shall be PAT tested to make sure that it is safe.

#### Airspace Safety

This project doesn't use drones or rockets or anything that can fly, and therefore this is not a risk.

#### Study Participant Safety

This project doesn't require surveys or tests and there for there is no risk to personal data breaches. This therefore is not a risk.

#### Data Infrastructure Safety

The first part of this project requires only locally hosted files, with backups and version control on GitHub. This should not compromise any of the college's IT systems as the only required bandwith is that to connect to GitHub.

The second part of this project will involve running software on equipment in Cambridge. This may require uploading software using the colleges network so that it can be run remotely. I will also have to access results and other information remotely. In these cases the software and files won't be accessing the network, only small files will be sent and therefore this should not pose a risk to the colleges's IT systems and infrastructure.

#### Laboratory Safety

I am doing most of my work in the ICRS Robotics Lab and 4th Year Laboratory that share the same space. I have carries out an induction for the ICRS lab so I can safely work in this space.
