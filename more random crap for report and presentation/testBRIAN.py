Polychronization: Computation with Spikes
Eugene M. Izhikevich
Neural Computation, 2006
This script shows a way to reproduce Izhikevich's network using Brian. Note
that there are a couple of slightly tricky technical points necessary to
reproduce Izhikevich's particular numerical integration scheme and STDP rule.
These are explained below.
This version of the script demonstrates the simplest version of the code
possible, the longer version of this script shows a much faster version which
saves the output and analyses the polychronous groups formed.

# operations on these matrices using the alldata attribute of Brian sparse

# want the actual starting values of Ce_deriv to be zero, but if we had done
# this before compressing to a ConnectionMatrix, all entries would be
# considered zero entries in the sparse matrix, and then Ce and Ce_deriv would
